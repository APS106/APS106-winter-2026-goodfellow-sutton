    "### Define the problem\n",
    "In the first part of our problem, we want to read historical stock price data from a file and store it within a `pandas` **DataFrame** object.\n",
    "We have a number of `.csv` files containing data from different companies. All the files are named \"*company*_stock_data.csv\" where *company* is the name of the company. \n",

    "\n",
    "### Define test cases\n",
    "We can use our set of files as a testcase. Some things that we will want to consider when determining if our solution is correct:\n",
    "* Does the DataFrame contain the columns we expect?\n",
    "* Does the DataFrame contain all the dates and price information from each file?\n",
    "* Is there any useful information missing from our DataFrame?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Generate solutions\n",
    "Based on the problem definition, here are some things that our program will need to do:\n",
    "* Create a DataFrame object to hold all of the data\n",
    "* Load the contents of a csv file into a DataFrame\n",
    "* Concatenate the data from each file into our DataFrame\n",
    "\n",
    "An algorithm plan could be:\n",
    "1. Create an empty DataFrame, `stock_df`\n",
    "2. Use a for loop to iterate over each company name\n",
    "    * Use string concatenation to define the filename for that company\n",
    "    * Load the file contents into a DataFrame, `company_df`\n",
    "    * Concatenate the file data `company_df` to `stock_df` "

    "Imagine that you purchased stocks from a few companies at some date in the past. Now you want to check how your investment is doing by calculating the ROI of your combined stocks. To compute your ROI, you need to calculate the initial cost of purchasing the stocks and their current value. The initial cost is the sum of the stock prices for the companies you purchased on the purchase date. The current value is the sum of stock prices for these companies on the current date.\n",
    "\n",
    "Write a function called `compute_ROI` that has the following parameters:\n",
    "* `df` - A dataframe object that has the same columns as the `stock_df` DataFrame\n",
    "* `companies` - A list of strings defining the company stocks that were purchased\n",
    "* `purchase_date` - A string defining the purchase date of the stocks\n",

    "To test our function, let's imagine we purchased Apple and TD Bank stocks on 2023-04-05 and we want to compute our ROI on 2024-04-03. On the purchase date, the stock prices of Apple and TD Bank were \\\\$163.76 and \\\\$58.98, respectively. On the current date, the prices are \\\\$169.65 and \\\\$59.61.\n",

    "### Generate Solutions\n",
    "1. Initialize variables `total_purchase_price = 0` and `total_current_value = 0`; these will be used to accumulate the sum of the prices for each stock on the purchase and current dates\n",

    "    * use `loc` to extract the rows from the DataFrame where the company column is equal to `company` and the date column is equal to `purchase_date`\n",
    "    * use `values` to extract the numerical value from the Close/Last column\n",
    "    * Add the values to the `total_purchase_price`\n",
