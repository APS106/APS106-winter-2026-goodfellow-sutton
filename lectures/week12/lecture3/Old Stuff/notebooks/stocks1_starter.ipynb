    "On Dec. 20, 1966, the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) switched to a fully automated computerized trading system. A few years later, in 1971, Nasdaq launched as the world's first fully electronic stock market.\n",

    "## Part 1 - Read stock price data from csv file\n",
    "\n",
    "### Define the Problem\n",
    "In the first part of our problem, we want to read historical stock price data from a file and store it within variables in our program.\n",
    "\n",
    "As an example, we'll use the csv file `netflix_stock_data.csv` which contains the daily Netflix stock prices between Apr. 5, 2023 and Apr. 3, 2024 (you can download a csv file of the most recent Netflix stock prices here: https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/nflx/historical).\n",
    "\n",
    "The first column in the csv file contains a date and the second column contains the price of a single stock on that date. We'll ignore the other columns for this problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "One way to store this historical price information in our program is using a **dictionary**. We will use the dates (strings) as **keys** and the corresponding prices (floats) as **values**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Define Test Cases\n",
    "We can use the file of Netflix stock prices as a test case. Some things that we will want to consider when determining if our solution is correct:\n",
    "* Are the keys in the dictionary strings? Are they all valid dates?\n",
    "* Are the values in the dictionary floats?\n",
    "* Are the prices in the dictionary paired with the correct dates?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Generate solutions\n",
    "Based on the problem definition, here are some things that our program will need to do:\n",
    "* Open a csv file for reading\n",
    "* Extract date and price information from the first and second column on each line in the file\n",
    "* Add the date and price information to a dictionary\n",
    "\n",
    "An algorithm plan could be:\n",
    "1. Create an empty dictionary\n",
    "2. Open the csv file for reading\n",
    "3. Use a loop to process each line in the file, for each line:\n",
    "    a. Extract the date and price\n",
    "    b. Add the date and price pair to the dictionary\n",

    "\n",
    "Now let's create a stock class that we can use to represent stocks and their prices over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Define the problem\n",
    "Our stock objects will have two attributes:\n",
    "1. `name` - a 3 or 4 letter string representing the name of the stock, e.g. NTFX for Netflix\n",
    "2. `prices` - a dictionary of date-price values\n",
    "\n",
    "We will also give our stock class the following methods:\n",
    "1. `price` - Given a date, return the price of the stock on that date. If the date is invalid (e.g., a weekend), print a message indicating the price is not available at that date and return `-1.0`.\n",
    "2. `price_change` - Compute and then return the change in the stock's price between two dates. If either date is invalid, return `0.0`.\n",
    "3. `mean_price` - Compute and then return the average price of the stock for the dates where data is available.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Define test cases\n",
    "A simple test case for the `price_change` method would be to check the change in price between `'04/03/2024'` and `'04/05/2023'`. \n",
    "For the `mean_price` method, we can use our Netflix stock as our test case.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Generate solutions\n",
    "An algorithm plan for our `price_change` method might be:\n",
    "1. Lookup the price of the stock at date2 in the object's price attribute\n",
    "2. Lookup the price of the stock at date1 in the object's price attribute\n",
    "3. Compute and return the difference between the prices at date2 and date1\n",
    "\n",
    "An algorithm plan for the `mean_price` method might be:\n",
    "1. Initialize a variable `sum=0`\n",
    "2. For each date in the object's price attribute:\n",
    "    * Extract the price at that date\n",
    "    * Add this price to `sum`\n",
    "3. Divide `sum` by the length of the dictionary in the object's price attribute\n",
